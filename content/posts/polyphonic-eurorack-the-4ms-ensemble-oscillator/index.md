description: "As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the Times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames."

As covid gifted me with more free time (and [reamp labs](https://www.youtube.com/reamplabs) has been on hold for the past two years) I started a new Youtube channel called [pitch patch](https://www.youtube.com/pitchpatch). I will be posting videos about music-making, tutorials, reviews, and demos.

In [the first-ever pitch patch video](https://youtu.be/f8w8C_G0m2g), I go through all knobs and functions and show you two patch ideas of the 4ms Ensemble Oscillator.

The Ensemble Oscillator was designed by Matthias Puech and 4ms Company and is a polyphonic voice of sixteen sine-based oscillators combining additive, FM, phase-distortion, and wave folding synthesis techniques.

You can get further information about the 4ms Ensemble Oscillator, the manual, and firmware updates [here](https://bit.ly/3w288Ug).
