      <description>As covid gifted me with more free time (and reamp labs has been on hold for the past two years) I started a new Youtube channel called pitch patch. I will be posting videos about music-making, tutorials, reviews, and demos.
In the first-ever pitch patch video, I go through all knobs and functions and show you two patch ideas of the 4ms Ensemble Oscillator.
The Ensemble Oscillator was designed by Matthias Puech and 4ms Company and is a polyphonic voice of sixteen sine-based oscillators combining additive, FM, phase-distortion, and wave folding synthesis techniques.</description>
